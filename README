This README serves as a basic instruction guide for microbiome exploratory analysis.
This instruction guide was created during the analysis of 34 pregnant women's gut microbiome acquired from IUPUI's health center. Dr. Yuzhen Ye is the principal investigator for this project. Data was analyzed by Genevieve Mortensen with assistance from Kate Mortensen and Yebin Kim.

PURPOSE:

The aim of this study is to identify differential putative microbial metabolic pathway expressions and taxonomic abundances between control and case groups as a method of correlating microbiome characteristics with phenotype.

DATA DESCRIPTION:

A total of 50 samples are analyzed in this study. Women submitted samples in up to 3 visits, during their first trimester, their second, and postpartum. Tobacco use, BMI, age of consent, and race are some of the relevant elements of each subject reported in the metadata. Samples are grouped together with their subjects, and a semi-representative control group is compared with a case group. Phenotypes concerning this study include gestational diabetes and various types of hypertension. Data contributing to this study include Kuang (2017) study on GDM and Lin (2022) study on pregnancy-induced hypertension, or PHI. These datasets are much larger and were acquired via ENA to better characterize our data.
Short, paired-end, Illumina sequencing reads in multiple fastq.gz files. Illumina adapters are retained in the DNA sequences. These adapters are clipped off and the human host genome is removed from each set of sequences, leaving only bacterial microbiome sequences. 

WORKFLOW DESCRIPTION:

To begin, prepare an Anconda environment for ease of tool installation.
If data is stored remotely, download files in a fastq format using ENA's browser tools.
Trim Illumina ends using trimmomatic
Remove host using bowtie
Assess quality using multi-qc
Perform functional profile using HumanN3
Perform taxonomic profile using braken/kraken
Conduct statistical tests on functional profile using associated R and python scripts
Conduct statistical tests on taxonomic profile using associated R and python scripts
Create visualizations with R and python.

DIRECTORY INFORMATION:

Data used to perform analysis is located in /data. Each subfolder is named according to the tool which produced the files located within them. The raw sequences are located in /data/sequence. Databases used to perform functional and taxonomic profiling are located in /database. Scripts created to perform file processing, statistical evaluation, microbiome profiling, and visualization are located in /scripts. Subscripts used to perform taxonomic profiling are located in /lib.

RESULTS:

Regarding Hoosier data, our samples showed poor clustering using PCA methods on both gene family and metabolic pathway analysis resolutions, however, variability between metabolic pathway resolutions for case and controls suggested that the smaller dataset is a better way to characterize. Additionally, case and control samples appeared to follow a similar functional profile pattern when compared to PCA plots published in Lin, et al. 2022. 
*The next step is to incorporate data from Kuang and Lin and identify differences between these datasets, and merge them with the Hoosier data,*
*Yebin is currently working on the taxonomic profile.*
